This rule can register to equations and always\nreturn Rule.NA. It checks all the outgoing edges of the equation and\nreports each violation using add_rule_status with the equation’s OID and\nthe name of the edge’s local variable as local OID.\nThe Rule class provides support for this use case.\nadd_rule_status: This method is redefined to address both\nSCADE Metrics and Rules Checker 2024 R2 and former releases.\nThe local_id parameter is discarded for former releases.\nMoreover, this method maintains, in a cache, a dictionary of these violations\nto prevent duplicated violations. This eases the development of rules in\nsome circumstances.\non_stop: This method empties the cache of violations. It must be called\nif it is overridden in derived classes.\nget_closest_annotatable: This method returns the closest owner that\nhas an OID, for an element.
